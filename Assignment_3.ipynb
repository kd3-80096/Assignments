    "#### 1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- Use of functions enhances the readability of a program. A big code is always difficult to read. Breaking the code in smaller Functions keeps the program organized, easy to understand and makes it reusable"

    "#### 2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- When a function is \"called\" the program \"leaves\" the current section of code and begins to execute the first line inside the function. Thus the function \"flow of control\" is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The program comes to a line of code containing a \"function call\".\n",
    "2.The program enters the function (starts at the first line in the function code).\n",
    "3.All instructions inside of the function are executed from top to bottom.\n",
    "4.The program leaves the function and goes back to where it started from.\n",
    "5.Any data computed and RETURNED by the function is used in place of the function in the original line of code."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- A function is a piece of code which enhanced the reusability and modularity of your program. It means that piece of code need not be written again.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:- In programming, the scope of a name defines the area of a program in which you can unambiguously access that name, such as variables, functions, objects, and so on. A name will only be visible to and accessible by the code in its scope. Several programming languages take advantage of scope for avoiding name collisions and unpredictable behaviors. Most commonly, you’ll distinguish two general scopes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Global scope: The names that you define in this scope are available to all your code.\n",

The statements after the return statements are not executed. If the return statement is without any expression, then the special value None is returned.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can use the return statement inside a function only.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, every function returns something. If there are no return statements, then it returns None.\n",
